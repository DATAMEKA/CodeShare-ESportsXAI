Data Format
-----------

-   The provided data consists of compressed files capturing the gameplay of top performers from January 2021 to May 2022.

-   To utilize the data, you need to decompress the files, extracting JSON files containing in-game data.

-   If you encounter challenges in decompressing and transforming the JSON files, refer to the example notebook provided for guidance.

-   The dataset includes two types of games: LAN games (680 games) and Online games (878 games).

-   Each decompressed JSON file is approximately 70 to 80 MB in size, making it difficult to analyze entire games for analysis purposes.

-   We recommend starting with a portion of the data and gradually increasing the number of games for analysis, allowing for more manageable exploration and understanding of the dataset.
